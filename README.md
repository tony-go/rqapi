# Hi 👋🏼,

This repository is material for this [article](https://tonygo.dev/blog/why-developer-should-use-gherkin/).

We use the `hello.feature` file as the source of truth for our test.

## The feature in Express.Js

Checkout the branch `express-version`, then run command `npm run test`.

## Revamp in Fastify.Js

Checkout the branch `fastify-version`, then run command `npm run test`.

> Note: Between both branches we did not update the hello.feature file.
